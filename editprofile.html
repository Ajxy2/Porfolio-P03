								<p>Edit profile is a transformative social card game where players create
									 fictional characters using a variety of traits. Players must use the
									 traits associated with the character and persuade a judge on why their
									  character is better than others. The transformative aspect helps players
										 think more positively about certain traits they have and think about
										 those traits more positively</p>

										<h2>First step</h2>
										<p>	Inspired by cards against humanity we wanted to create a social game
											 where people could pick up and play at any time with friends. At
											 first my group created a card game where players played good and
											 unusual traits and would have to explain why theyâ€™re good. </p>

												<h2>Incorporating Sharks</h2>
												<p>		After playtesting and feedback, I separated the traits into good physical and
													 personality to make the characters more structured. Also styling the cards so
													 that users can tell what category trait the card is from both sides.</p>

						<p>We were challenged to create a transformative game where people can play
							 for fun. We wanted to tackle the issue of mental health since It's an
							  issue that is uncomfortable talking about at times and a lot of people
								 deal with mental health issues.<p>
